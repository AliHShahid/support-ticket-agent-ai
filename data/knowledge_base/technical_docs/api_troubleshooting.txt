API TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

1. COMMON ERROR CODES
- 400 Bad Request: Check request format and required parameters
- 401 Unauthorized: Verify API key is valid and properly formatted
- 403 Forbidden: Check account permissions and rate limits
- 404 Not Found: Verify endpoint URL and resource existence
- 429 Too Many Requests: Rate limit exceeded, implement backoff
- 500 Internal Server Error: Temporary server issue, retry after delay

2. AUTHENTICATION ISSUES
- API keys must be included in Authorization header
- Format: "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
- Keys expire after 1 year and must be renewed
- Test authentication with /auth/verify endpoint

3. RATE LIMITING
- Basic Plan: 100 requests per minute
- Professional Plan: 1,000 requests per minute
- Enterprise Plan: 10,000 requests per minute
- Use exponential backoff when hitting limits

4. INTEGRATION BEST PRACTICES
- Always validate responses before processing
- Implement proper error handling and retries
- Use webhooks for real-time updates when possible
- Cache responses when appropriate to reduce API calls

5. DEBUGGING STEPS
1. Check API key validity
2. Verify request format matches documentation
3. Test with curl or Postman first
4. Check server status at status.ourservice.com
5. Review API logs in dashboard

6. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
- Use batch endpoints when available
- Implement request caching
- Use compression for large payloads
- Monitor response times and optimize accordingly
